<hr />
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>The movie was a three times watch just to get an idea. A must watch and not one to think too much.</p>
<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>Really cool sci-fi movie. It talks about nature too.</p>
<h3>Interesteller</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. A sci-fi and it first make you think and watch again to re-analyze what you watched first time.</p>
